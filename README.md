## Download
Can you trust the download? Well yes and no. Because how should I prove to you, that the code of a built application is the same as the repository code? I can't. But I personally believe in the open source project, and want to contribute to a better software accessability for everyone. So either you take my word, or compile the code yourself =)

If your anti virus program rings an alarm bell, please notify me, via github issues or e-mail, so that I see, whether I can deploy my application like this or not.
